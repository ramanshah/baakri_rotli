# Scalable recipes for Gujarati flatbread

This is an effort to reduce my mom's experience-driven cooking of unleavened
Gujarati flatbreads to measurement-driven recipes for the Western baker.

## Usage

These recipes are intended to be used with my
[`bread`](https://github.com/ramanshah/bread) program for scaling recipes at
the command line.  They are written down to use 1 g of flour; if I'm making
*rotli* and I pour out 124 g of durum atta (eyeballing the portion I feel will
suffice for dinner), I can pop over to the computer and type in a UNIX-like
terminal:

```
$ bread rotli.yml 124
------------------------------
Rotli
------------------------------
durum atta (flour)       124 g
water, room temperature 89.3 g
vegetable oil           9.92 g
------------------------------
```

Then I know how much water and oil to use to have a well-executed *rotli*
dough.
